Much of the code and comments was taken directly from Aurélien Géron, specifically from his work in "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 3rd Edition"

Objective here was to become acquainted with the process of creating and training a ML model, as well as with the process of fine tuning and preparing it for launch. Numerous comments were included to aid with this process.
